# 🎯 WEEK BUNDLE SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
**AI Textbook Reader: Multi-Source Content Aggregation**

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025  
**Goal:** Build content aggregation for ONE week of ONE course (CSE 120 Week 3)  
**Timeline:** 5-hour intensive build  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

**Transform learning from single-source to multi-source:**
- **Before:** Upload textbook → Read pages → Use AI on that textbook only
- **After:** Select course/week → AI finds ALL materials → Unified viewer → AI knows about everything

**Core Features:**
1. **Parallel AI Aggregation** - Find textbooks, slides, homework, papers
2. **Multi-Content Catalog** - Browse all materials by type
3. **Unified Viewer** - View everything in one place
4. **Content-Aware AI** - Chat/notes that cross-reference all sources

**Key Principle:** Existing textbook reader stays 100% intact - this is a parallel feature

---

## 📊 SCOPE CLARITY

### **What We Built**
- CSE 120 Week 3 ONLY (Process Scheduling)
- Parallel AI finds: textbook sections + slides + homework + papers
- Unified viewer with content switcher
- AI notes/chat that know about ALL materials
- **No sprint scheduling** (just content aggregation)

### **What Changed from Original Roadmap**

| Removed (Sprint System) | Added (Week Bundle) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| 7-day study plan generation | Single week content aggregation |
| Daily session tracking | Material access tracking |
| Knowledge mastery nodes | Multi-source awareness |
| Study session scheduling | Content catalog browsing |
| Sprint questions table | Content-aware AI chat |
| 10-week course structure | Focus on Week 3 only |

---

## 📋 PHASE-BY-PHASE BUILD

### **PHASE 1: Parallel AI Integration (1 hour)** ✅

**Files Created:**
- `/src/lib/parallel.ts` - Parallel API client
- `/api/week/aggregate-content.ts` - Aggregation endpoint
- `/scripts/test-parallel.ts` - Test script

**What It Does:**
```typescript
const result = await aggregateWeekContent({
  courseCode: 'CSE 120',
  institution: 'UCSD',
  weekNumber: 3,
  weekTopic: 'Process Scheduling'
});

// Returns: textbooks, slides, homework, papers with metadata
```

**Testing:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-parallel.ts
```

---

### **PHASE 2: Database Schema (30 minutes)** ✅

**File Created:** `schema-week-bundles.sql`

**Three New Tables:**

1. **week_bundles** - Course week metadata + aggregated content JSON
```sql
CREATE TABLE week_bundles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  course_code TEXT,           -- "CSE 120"
  institution TEXT,           -- "UCSD"
  week_number INT,
  week_topic TEXT,
  aggregated_content JSONB,   -- Full Parallel response
  ...
);
```

2. **content_items** - Individual materials catalog
```sql
CREATE TABLE content_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  week_bundle_id UUID REFERENCES week_bundles,
  content_type TEXT,          -- textbook, slides, homework, paper
  title TEXT,
  source_url TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  confidence_score FLOAT,
  ...
);
```

3. **content_access** - Track what user viewed
```sql
CREATE TABLE content_access (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  content_item_id UUID REFERENCES content_items,
  page_number INT,
  duration_seconds INT,
  ...
);
```

**To Install:**
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents of schema-week-bundles.sql
```

---

### **PHASE 3: Week Bundle Viewer UI (1.5 hours)** ✅

**Files Created:**
- `/src/contexts/WeekBundleContext.tsx` - State management
- `/src/components/week/WeekBundleView.tsx` - Main page (3-column layout)
- `/src/components/week/ContentCatalog.tsx` - Left sidebar (materials list)
- `/src/components/week/ContentViewer.tsx` - Center pane (viewer)

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
WeekBundleView (Route: /week/:bundleId)
├── ContentCatalog (Left)
│   ├── Textbooks section
│   ├── Slides section
│   ├── Homework section
│   └── Papers section
├── ContentViewer (Center)
│   ├── PDFReader (for textbooks, slides, papers) [REUSED]
│   └── HomeworkViewer (simple problems display) [NEW]
└── MinimalAIPane (Right) [REUSED]
```

**What It Reuses:**
- Existing `PDFReader` component for all PDF materials
- Existing `MinimalAIPane` for AI features
- Existing UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)

---

### **PHASE 4: Content-Aware AI (1 hour)** ✅

**Files Created:**
- `/api/week/chat.ts` - Multi-source chat endpoint
- `/api/week/generate-notes.ts` - Multi-source notes generation

**What Changed:**

**OLD (Textbook-only):**
```typescript
const context = {
  pageText: currentPage.text,
  textbookTitle: textbook.title
};
// Claude only knows about current textbook page
```

**NEW (Multi-source):**
```typescript
const context = {
  currentContent: { type: 'textbook', title: 'Silberschatz Ch. 5', page: 190 },
  weekBundle: {
    textbooks: [...],
    slides: [...],
    homework: [...],
    papers: [...]
  }
};
// Claude knows about ALL materials and can cross-reference
```

**Example AI Response:**
> "Round Robin scheduling is explained in Silberschatz Ch. 5 (pp. 195-198). The Week 3 slides have a visual diagram on slide 23. This concept is tested in Problem Set 3, problems 3.2 and 3.3. For real-world implementation, see the 'Linux CFS' paper which compares it to modern approaches."

---

### **PHASE 5: Integration & Access (30 minutes)** ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/main.tsx` - Added BrowserRouter and routes
- `/src/components/MinimalHeader.tsx` - Added Week Bundle link

**Routing Structure:**
```
/ (root)                    → Existing textbook reader
/week/:bundleId             → Week bundle viewer (NEW)
```

**Navigation:**
Added "CSE 120 Week 3" button in header that links to `/week/demo-cse120-week3`

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Add to .env or Vercel/Railway environment
PARALLEL_API_KEY=your_parallel_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key  # For Claude Sonnet 4.5
```

3. **Run Database Migration:**
- Open Supabase SQL Editor
- Copy contents of `schema-week-bundles.sql`
- Run the script

### **Development:**

1. **Test Parallel Aggregation:**

### **Creating a Week Bundle:**

**Option 1: Via API (Programmatic)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/week/aggregate-content \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "institution": "UCSD",
    "weekNumber": 3,
    "weekTopic": "Process Scheduling",
    "userId": "YOUR_USER_ID"
  }'
```

**Option 2: Via UI (Future Enhancement)**
- Add "Create Week Bundle" dialog
- User inputs: course code, week number, topic
- Calls API, redirects to new bundle

## 📋 DEMO NARRATIVE

> "I'm taking CSE 120: Operating Systems at UCSD. For Week 3 on Process Scheduling, I used to hunt down materials across the course website, textbook, and research papers separately.
>
> Now, I click 'Week 3' and AI has already found everything: the relevant textbook chapters from Silberschatz and Tanenbaum, the professor's lecture slides, this week's homework problems, and 3 recent research papers on Linux scheduling.
>
> Everything is in one unified interface. As I read, the AI automatically generates notes that reference ALL these materials. When I ask a question, it doesn't just cite the textbook - it cross-references the slides, relates it to homework problems, and points me to the relevant research paper.
>
> For example, when I ask about Round Robin scheduling, it tells me: 'This is covered in Silberschatz Ch. 5, pages 195-198. The Week 3 slides have a visual diagram on slide 23. You'll need this for Problem 3.2. For real-world implementation, check the Linux CFS paper.'
>
> One interface, all my materials, AI that understands everything."

- [ ] Automatic weekly bundle generation (every Sunday)
- [ ] Flashcard generation from all sources
- [ ] Practice questions synthesized from textbook + papers
- [ ] Progress tracking across weeks

### **Long-term (Month 4+):**
- [ ] Full sprint scheduling (bring back original roadmap)

- [ ] Spaced repetition across materials
- [ ] Collaborative bundles (share with classmates)
- [ ] Professor dashboard (create bundles for students)

## 🚨 WHAT THIS DOESN'T BREAK

**Your existing app continues to work perfectly:**
- ✅ Upload textbook → works
- ✅ Read pages → works
- ✅ Chat about current page → works
- ✅ Notes panel → works
- ✅ All AI features → work
- ✅ Search → works
- ✅ User authentication → works

**Week Bundle is completely separate:**
- Lives at `/week/:id` (new route)
- Uses new database tables
- Reuses your existing components
- Can be removed without affecting main app

**Separation of Concerns:**
```
Main App (/)
├── Textbook upload/reading
├── Page-by-page navigation
├── Notes on individual pages
└── AI for current page context

Week Bundle (/week/:id)
├── Multi-source aggregation
├── Content catalog browsing
├── Unified viewing
└── AI with full week context
```
