# Week Bundle System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Status: COMPLETE

All 5 phases of the Week Bundle System have been successfully implemented according to the plan.

---

## üì¶ What Was Built

### Core Concept
A **multi-source content aggregation system** that uses Parallel AI to find and unify all course materials (textbooks, slides, homework, papers) for a single week of study, with AI features that understand and cross-reference all sources.

### Scope
- **Course:** CSE 120 (Operating Systems) at UCSD
- **Week:** Week 3 - Process Scheduling
- **Materials:** 4 types (textbooks, slides, homework, papers)
- **AI:** Content-aware chat and notes that know about ALL materials

---

## üéØ Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Parallel AI Integration ‚úÖ

**Files Created:**
1. `/src/lib/parallel.ts` (277 lines)
   - Parallel API client with TypeScript types
   - `aggregateWeekContent()` function for content aggregation
   - `quickConceptLookup()` for fast searches
   - Mock data for CSE 120 Week 3 (for development)

2. `/api/week/aggregate-content.ts` (283 lines)
   - Vercel serverless endpoint
   - Creates week bundles in database
   - Populates content items from Parallel response
   - Handles both real API and mock data

3. `/scripts/test-parallel.ts` (112 lines)
   - Test script with formatted console output
   - Shows materials found grouped by type
   - Displays confidence scores and metadata
   - Outputs JSON for database insertion

**Testing:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-parallel.ts
```

---

### Phase 2: Database Schema ‚úÖ

**File Created:**
`schema-week-bundles.sql` (222 lines)

**Tables:**
1. **week_bundles** - Stores course week metadata
   - Fields: course_code, institution, week_number, week_topic
   - Contains full Parallel aggregation results as JSONB
   - One bundle per user/course/week (UNIQUE constraint)

2. **content_items** - Individual materials catalog
   - Fields: content_type, title, source_url, metadata
   - Links to week_bundles with CASCADE delete
   - Confidence scores from Parallel AI

3. **content_access** - User access tracking
   - Fields: page_number, duration_seconds, accessed_at
   - Tracks auto-notes generation and questions answered
   - Session tracking for analytics

**Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

   - State management for bundles, content items, selection
   - Functions: `loadBundle()`, `createBundle()`, `selectContent()`
   - Access tracking: `trackAccess()`, `updateAccessDuration()`
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data types

2. `/src/components/week/WeekBundleView.tsx` (102 lines)
   - Main page with 3-column layout
   - Header showing course code, week, topic
   - Layout: Catalog | Viewer | AI Pane
   - Loading and error states

3. `/src/components/week/ContentCatalog.tsx` (154 lines)

- All shadcn/ui components (buttons, cards, alerts, etc.)

---

### Phase 4: Content-Aware AI ‚úÖ

**Files Created:**

1. `/api/week/chat.ts` (186 lines)
   - Enhanced chat endpoint with multi-source context
   - Builds context from ALL materials in week bundle
   - System prompt teaches Claude to cross-reference sources
   - Streaming responses via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Example AI response:
     ```
     "Round Robin is in Silberschatz Ch. 5 (pp. 195-198). 
      The Week 3 slides show a diagram on slide 23. 
      This relates to Problem 3.2 in the homework. 
      For real-world implementation, see the Linux CFS paper."
     ```

2. `/api/week/generate-notes.ts` (161 lines)
   - Multi-source note generation
   - Context includes current content + all week materials
   - Notes formatted with sections:
     - Main Concepts
     - Key Definitions
     - Examples
     - Related Materials (cross-references)
     - Study Tips

**Context Enhancement:**

**Before (textbook-only):**
```typescript
context = {
  pageText: currentPage.text,
  textbookTitle: textbook.title
}
```

**After (multi-source):**
```typescript
context = {
  currentContent: { type, title, page },
  weekBundle: {
    textbooks: [...],
    slides: [...],
    homework: [...],
    papers: [...]
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Decisions

### Why These Choices Were Made

1. **Reused PDFReader Instead of Creating New Viewers**
   - Avoids code duplication
   - Maintains consistent PDF viewing experience
   - Same component for textbooks, slides, and papers

2. **JSONB for aggregated_content**
   - Flexible schema for Parallel API responses
   - Easy to add new material types
   - Query-able with PostgreSQL JSON functions

3. **Separate Context (WeekBundleContext) Instead of Extending TextbookContext**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Week bundles independent of textbook reader
   - Can be removed without breaking existing features

4. **Mock Data in Client and Server**
   - Development without API keys
   - Consistent test data for CSE 120 Week 3
   - Fallback if Parallel API unavailable

5. **Content-Aware AI via Enhanced Endpoints**
   - New endpoints instead of modifying existing
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Different context structure for week bundles
