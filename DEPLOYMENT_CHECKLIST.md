# 🚀 Web Context Bootstrapping - Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All code has been committed and pushed to GitHub. Vercel will auto-deploy.

## 📋 Required Actions (5 minutes)

### 1. Update Database Schema
```sql
-- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard → Your Project → SQL Editor
-- Copy/paste contents of: schema-web-context.sql
-- Click "RUN"
```

**What it does**: Creates `textbook_web_context` table and adds `metadata_ready` column

### 2. Add Tavily API Key (Optional but Recommended)

**Get Free API Key** (1000 searches/month):
1. Go to https://tavily.com
2. Sign up with email
3. Copy API key from dashboard

**Add to Vercel**:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ai-textbook-reader-design`
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - Name: `TAVILY_API_KEY`
   - Value: `tvly-YOUR_KEY_HERE`
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development
5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy (automatic after save)

**If you skip this**: System will still work with basic context (title + author only)

### 3. Test the Feature

1. Go to https://ai-textbook-reader-design.vercel.app
2. Upload a NEW PDF textbook
3. Watch for toast notifications:
   - ✅ "Reading PDF metadata..."
   - ✅ "Context loading in background..."
4. **Immediately open Chat panel** (don't wait for extraction)
5. Should see: ✅ "Textbook context ready • Ask anything now" within 1-2 seconds
6. Ask a question like: "What is this textbook about?"
7. Should get relevant answer using web context
8. Wait 5-10s, ask again - answers should get more specific as pages extract

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Timeline:
- **0-0.2s**: Metadata extracted
- **0.2-2s**: Web context fetched and cached
- **2s+**: Chat enabled with web overview
- **5-10s**: First pages extracted, answers improve
- **45-75s**: Full extraction complete, perfect accuracy

### Visual Indicators:
- 🕐 "Checking textbook context..." (during check)
- ⏳ "Loading textbook background context..." (fetching)
- ✅ "Textbook context ready • Ask anything now" (ready)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Schema Issues
```bash
# If you get RLS policy errors:
# 1. Check if textbook_web_context table exists
# 2. Run schema-web-context.sql again
# 3. Verify RLS is enabled on the table
```

### Tavily API Issues
- **Error 401**: API key is wrong → Check Vercel env var
- **Error 429**: Exceeded free tier (1000/month) → Wait or upgrade
- **Timeout**: No problem, system uses fallback context

### Context Not Loading
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors in Network tab
3. Check `/api/fetch-textbook-context` endpoint
4. Verify Supabase connection works

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check if it's working:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  t.title,
  wc.status,
  wc.fetched_at,
  LENGTH(wc.web_summary) as summary_length
FROM textbooks t
LEFT JOIN textbook_web_context wc ON t.id = wc.textbook_id
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Expected results:
- `status` should be `'fetched'`
- `summary_length` should be > 100 characters
- `fetched_at` should be within seconds of textbook creation

## 🎉 Success Criteria

✅ Schema updated without errors
✅ Vercel deployment successful
✅ Upload new PDF → see "Context loading in background..."
✅ Chat shows green checkmark within 2 seconds
✅ Chat responds intelligently before full extraction
✅ Answers improve as extraction progresses

## 📝 Notes

- Web context is cached forever (no re-fetches on reload)
- Fallback gracefully works without API key
- Works for both client-side and Railway extractions
- No breaking changes to existing textbooks
- Backwards compatible with all existing features
