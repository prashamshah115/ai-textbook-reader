## My Recommendation: Start with Groq

### Why Groq?
- ✅ **FREE** (14,400 requests/day)
- ✅ **FAST** (300 tokens/sec)
- ✅ **SIMPLE** (one API key, works immediately)
- ✅ **GOOD** (Llama 3.1 70B is excellent)

### Setup (2 minutes):
1. Go to https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create API key
4. Add to Vercel env vars

### Cost for your use case:
- **Free tier limit:** 14,400 requests/day
- **Your usage:** ~200 requests per textbook (1 per page)
- **Can process:** 72 textbooks/day for FREE
- **More than enough for MVP!**

## What Each Piece Does

### 1. PDF Processing (✅ DONE)
```
User uploads → Text extracted → Stored in DB
Status: Ready to go after deploy!
```

### 2. AI Processing (🔨 BUILD NEXT - 1 hour)
```
For each page:
  Input: "Chapter 1: Introduction to Neural Networks..."
  AI Model: Process with prompts
  Output: {
    summary: "This chapter introduces...",
    key_concepts: ["backpropagation", "gradient descent"],
    practice_questions: [...]
  }
  Save to DB
```

**Code needed:**
- `/api/process-pdf-ai.ts` - Endpoint
- Call Groq API with prompts
- Store results

### 3. Notes Sync (🔨 BUILD NEXT - 20 min)
```
User types note → Debounce 1 sec → Save to Supabase
On page change → Load notes from DB
```

**Code needed:**
- Add `saveNote()` to NotesContext
- Use `supabase.from('user_notes').upsert()`

### 4. Chat (📅 LATER - 2 hours)
```
User asks: "Explain backpropagation"
  → Search relevant pages
  → Build context
  → Ask AI
  → Stream response
```

**Why later:**
- More complex (need vector search or keyword matching)
- Less critical than summaries
- Can use basic summaries first

## Recommended Build Order

### Phase 1: Deploy & Test (Today)
```bash
# 1. Deploy what we have
vercel --prod

# 2. Test PDF upload
# Should work immediately!

# 3. Verify in Supabase
# Check textbooks table, pages table
```

### Phase 2: AI Processing (Today)
```bash
# 1. Get Groq API key
# 2. Create /api/process-pdf-ai.ts
# 3. Deploy
# 4. Test: Upload PDF → AI processes → See summaries
```

### Phase 3: Notes (Today)
```bash
# 1. Modify NotesContext.tsx
# 2. Add database sync
# 3. Test: Write note → Refresh → Still there
```

### Phase 4: Polish (Tomorrow)
```bash
# 1. Show AI processing status
# 2. Add loading states
# 3. Error handling
# 4. Make it pretty
```

### Phase 5: Advanced (Next Week)
```bash
# 1. Chat functionality
# 2. Practice questions UI
# 3. Export features
# 4. Sharing
```

## What You'll Have After Today

✅ Upload any PDF textbook
✅ Automatic text extraction
✅ AI-generated summaries for every page
✅ AI-generated key concepts
✅ AI-generated practice questions
✅ Take notes that persist
✅ Read with AI assistance panel

## Cost Breakdown (Monthly)

### Option A: All Free (Groq + Supabase Free Tier)
- Groq API: $0
