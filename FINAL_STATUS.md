## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Chapter detection**: Works for ~90% of textbooks. May need manual adjustment for unusual formats.
2. **Scanned PDFs**: Won't extract text (need OCR, future feature).
3. **Very large PDFs** (1000+ pages): May take 1-2 minutes to process.
4. **Non-English textbooks**: GROQ/OpenAI support 50+ languages, should work fine.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

1. **Spaced repetition** - Schedule recall questions
2. **Highlighting** - Persistent highlights in PDF
3. **Flashcards** - Generate from key concepts
4. **Mobile app** - React Native version
5. **Offline mode** - Service worker + IndexedDB
6. **OCR support** - For scanned PDFs
7. **Collaboration** - Share notes with others
